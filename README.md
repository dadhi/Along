# Along

**WIP! DRAFT!**

Along is the ideal programming language for me.


Notes for language design:

- Designed to get along with program change and growth
- Interpreted and compiled (assembly or llvm)
- Repl or the tool to play with language with minimal hassle
- Debugging
- Powerful one liners
- Composable out of small primitives
- Async in mind; extensible to other effects in mind
- The syntax and other featues should enable the DSLs
- Homoicony or lisp like simplified, but concise and explicit syntax without lispy brackets
- Get ideas for simplicity from the stack based languages e.g. Forth
- Low level and direct memory management with the gradual safety improvements
- Generics
- Type aliases
- Functional types in std lib
- Macros and tools to extend the language by users
- Compile-time programing in itself
- No build system or the builds in itself
- Simple packages
- Pay for play - the simplest things should be simple
- Power to the people - no blocking the unsafe features, just make them "guarded" by whatever means
- Prolog like solver as the natural language part
